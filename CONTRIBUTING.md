# Contributing to Eclipse Packaging Project

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The objectives of the Eclipse Packaging project are to Create entry level
downloads based on defined user profiles. The project defined and created the
EPP downloads of Java Developer, Java EE Developer, C/C++ Developer and RCP
Developer. These downloads are available from the main Eclipse download page.
Provide a platform that allows the creation of packages (zip/tar downloads) from
an update site. The core technology of the project will enable the creation of
download packages that are created by bundling Eclipse features from one or
multiple Eclipse update sites.
